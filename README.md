# Seed - The Decentralized Cooperative Networking Approach

Seed is a cooperative proof-of-work blockchain. The protocol will allow for the creation of mudules to run decentralized applications on the network. The end goal of Seed is to attempt to create a network which can achieve near real-time networking requirements when needed that runs on a truly distributed minner-less network of users.

# Research Proposals

Two research proposals written by Carson Roscoe & Jaegar Sarauer are in the /design folder. These proposals each contain literature reviews aimed at exploring the inefficiencies of blockchain technology, with the goals of combining the proposed solutions in each proposal. 

# Project Proposal

The research project proposal written by Carson Roscoe can be found in the /design folder. The proposal is simply the original proposal for the Seed project. The end design of the blockchain and project is subject to change.

# Seed Source Code

The Seed source code for the Seed npm module can be found in the /seedSrc folder. This folder is the initially created JavaScript implementation of the Seed protocol.

# Client Source Code

The Client source code is an Electron wallet being created for both the Seed cryptocurrency module, as well as for general interactions with the general Seed blockchain. This code can be found in the /clientSrc folder.

# Cryptography Design

In the /design folder a high-level explenation of the decided upon public key encryption, hashing and encoding scheme can
be found in the Project_Design_Cryptography.pdf file.

In the /seecSrc folder a text file detailing the methods and unit tests for the account.js and cryptoHelper.js files can be found. This is a lower-levle view on the details found in the Project_design_Cryptography.pdf file.
